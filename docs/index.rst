Swagrinth Documentation

Swagrinth is a api wrapper for Modrinth written in python

What you can do:
 - Retrieve data from modrinth's database. Projects, Users, Files, you name it

What you can't do (YET!):
 - Send data (ie modifying or creating projects)
 - troll face (soon)

I wanted to make a simple wrapper that was easy to understand and use,
mainly because I wanted something like this for a project I was working on, but no one had yet to make anything complete in python.
